    "- The tasks we solve with machine learning do not have ** one ** solution.",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The samples on which we teach the model (we called it the * black box *) are not enough on their own to tell if the model works well. The goal is not only the correct response on the given patterns, but also ** generalization **, ie the ability to correctly predict the response at points we have not seen before. We estimate the quality of ** generalization ** using patterns that were not used in learning, we call them ** test set **. The patterns we use in learning are referred to as ** training **.",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The test set should be sufficiently representative. If we have no other guide, we select the test set ** by random selection ** from the data.",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** metrics ** are used to assess the quality of the solution, we got acquainted with the basic metrics for regression",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there are values in the data that are obviously not related to the predicted response (eg id, line numbers, etc.), we will not include them among the input variables (** flags **).",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don&#39;t use a sparrow cannon. If we have a direct algorithm to solve the problem, we will not use machine learning.",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The term ** hyper-parameters ** hides the parameters of the models, which we can set ourselves."
