# Home preparation for the first lesson of machine learning
** Required ** :)

The next lesson awaits us ** Introduction to machine learning and acquaintance with regression **.

We prepared the lesson so that it was as interactive as possible. That's why we're not
too excited to teach her online. But there is no other way, so please us
come help.

This time, your task is not to read the materials an hour ago, but on the contrary, to you
we forbid.

** We don't want to tell you how things are to be done, we want you to know what you want
to do and why. Therefore, our goal is to force you to follow the right procedure
** We need you not to be afraid to answer in class
questions, engage in debate and not be afraid to share your ideas. We will not be over the video
Have plenty of options to get you to do this, so try mentally in advance
prepare that we will want to hear your views and solutions from you. None
The answer is not wrong, whatever you come up with will be a plus. Don't worry, it's enough
that we are afraid.

And let's start with homework:

1. Download this [PDF] (static / landscape.pdf) and if you have the option to print.

3. Imagine that you hired a surveyor and sent him into the unknown
    countries. You gave him the coordinates of a few points (you now live in a simplified
    space, the coordinates are only one number) and he measured for you
    latitude at these points. The measured points are displayed on the downloaded page
    picture.

After measuring these points, the surveyor decided to become a data analyst,
    he signed up for a course from PyLadies and finished the measurement for good. We would
    but he wondered what the whole landscape might look like.

If you do not understand the downloaded image, look at this image:
! [country-example] (static / country-example.png)

On the horizontal axis we have the coordinate and on the vertical axis the altitude (it can
be negative, sea levels have risen due to global warming). Blue
points show measured values ​​at selected points, plotted curve
real landscape (measurements are accurate in this case, in reality it should be
does not have to).

Take a pencil and try to draw the landscape in the downloaded image as you imagine it according to the given measurements. (We don't care about
    interpolate! It is not necessary for your * line * to lead directly through the given
    body. Be aware that measurements may be subject to error. The surveyor also measured
    only in the points you entered (randomly selected), it does not have to be
    neither peaks, nor valleys, nor other significant points.)

Try to answer the following questions:

    ** Questions: **

    + Are you sure about your guess? There are more ways she could
        landscape look?

    + How would you measure the quality of your ability
        to estimate an unknown landscape?

    + If you had two solutions, how could you determine which one
        does it describe the country better?

    ** DON'T FORGET: **
    - Negooglit, think. Don't look for materials for an hour, solutions there as well
    is not.
    - It's not the right answer, it's about gathering as many ideas as possible
    they could look for the right solution together in class. Bad
    there is no answer!
    - We want to know everything you can think of, even if you think so
    like a stupid idea.
    - If you are in contact with other course participants, do not be afraid to invent
    together.
    - If you do not understand the entry, the error is not on your side. Answer the slack or
    by e-mail, we will explain.

3. Take a picture and send it in private with the answers to the questions
   message or email petra.vidnerova@gmail.com. At the beginning of the class your ideas
   we will summarize (do not worry, no one will be named) and talk about them.

4. Don't throw the picture, you will still need it in an hour!

5. In the first hour we will not deal with the implementation at all (there will be nothing
   program), but due to the functionality of laptops with materials, install
   scikitlearn library.
   `` `
   pip install sklearn
   `` `
