    "When working with data, there are many opportunities where interactivity is useful. When visualizing, zooming in / out, selecting a sub-area, showing plotted values, etc. is suitable. Or we want to make the results of our great analysis available to &quot;non-technical&quot; colleagues or friends who (yet) can&#39;t start the Jupyter laptop.",

    "\n",
    "There are other tools that provide similar options. You can find a detailed overview at https://pyviz.org/tools.html. For interactive visualizations, these are mainly [holoviews] (http://github.com/pyviz/holoviews) or [altair] (http://github.com/altair-viz/altair). On &quot;dashboarding&quot; then [dash] (http://github.com/plotly/dash), [panel] (https://panel.holoviz.org/), [voila] (http://github.com/ QuantStack / voila) or [justpy] (https://justpy.io).",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tools has, as usual, its advantages and disadvantages. The most common tool is [Dash] (http://github.com/plotly/dash) from the same workshop as plotly, which also provides enterprise solutions for running applications. Dash is definitely a good choice, as you can find out at the [lecture from the Prague PyData Meetup] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dewrzMPPLDU). The panel (and also the Voila) differs from the Dash in that it can also be used in a Jupyter laptop and then the laptop can be used directly as an application. The biggest advantage of `voila` is the simple way to make a dashboard directly from your laptop: see [documentation] (https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html).",
