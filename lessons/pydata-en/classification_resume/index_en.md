# Machine learning - classification


### What should I know after this class?

- What is the classification task, how to evaluate classifiers. Basic classification metrics.
    
- I know there are still many things to study for yourself. I will not be afraid to read the documentation [Scikit-learn] (https://scikit-learn.org).
