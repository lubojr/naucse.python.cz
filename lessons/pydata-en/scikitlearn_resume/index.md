# Machine learning - Scikit-learn, classification


### What should I know after this class?

- Basic functions of the Scikit-learn library and orientation in the Scikit-learn documentation.
    
- I know how to proceed at work, prepare data, learn and choose a model,
   test and validate your model.

- We do not use test data, but validation data to select the model and suitable hyper-parameters
     (which we get as part of the training).
    
- I know there are still many things to study for yourself. I will not be afraid to read the documentation [Scikit-learn] (https://scikit-learn.org).
